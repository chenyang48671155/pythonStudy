                "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of scholars' understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops.",

For five years, Quon’s team tested designs in a lab that mimicked Mars’s atmospheric conditions.

                "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation about a helicopter that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Mars’s atmosphere is much less dense than Earth’s, and as a result, the air on Mars doesn’t provide the resistance required to support the blades of a helicopter built for Earth and to keep the helicopter aloft. In other words, a helicopter built for Earth can’t fly on Mars because of the differences in the two planets’ atmospheres.",

One reason for this is that geologic and climate data collected by a spacecraft showed that the crust was largely composed of basalt, likely as a result of intense volcanic activity that brought about a magma ocean, which then cooled to form the planet’s surface. A study led by Valerie P ayré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica, P ayré concluded that ____",
                "explanation": "Cooling magma would create basalt, but “a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica.” Since Mars’s crust does contain large amounts of silica, it is unlikely that Mars’s crust was formed exclusively by cooling magma.

These platforms have made it easier than ever for people to access and listen to music, but there are also concerns about the impact they may have on the livelihood of musicians. Some argue that streaming platforms have made it harder for musicians to earn a living, as they often pay artists very little for their work. Others argue that streaming platforms have actually helped musicians to reach a wider audience and to build their careers. What is the author's main purpose in this passage?",

Isla was surprised that he didn’t recognize the figure, so he returned to Peru and used a drone to search a wide area, looking for the figure from the air.

The samples taken by Fierer’s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn’t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer’s team wouldn’t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn’t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer’s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn’t detect them, but the author doesn’t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes.

This finding suggests that experiencing awe may increase altruistic behavior, at least in the short term.",
                "explanation": "The question asks about a valid criticism of the experiment's design. Choice A is a valid criticism because a small sample size can make it difficult to generalize the results to a larger population. Choice C is a valid criticism because random assignment is essential for ensuring that the two groups are comparable at the start of the experiment. Choice D is a valid criticism because it is important to control for all potential confounding variables that could explain the results. Choice B is not a valid criticism because the experimenters cannot control for how engaging the participants find the videos.

Some\nhistorians have even used these objects to identify potential skin diseases that may have afflicted people at the time.\n\nArt historian and archaeologist Lisa Trever has argued that the interpretation of Moche “portrait” vessels as hyper-realistic\nportrayals of identifiable people may inadvertently disregard the creativity of the objects’ creators. Moche ceramic\nvessels, Trever argues, are artworks in which sculptors could free their imagination, using realistic objects and people\naround them as inspiration to explore more abstract concepts.",
                "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. Trever thinks that the “hyper-realistic portrayal of identifiable people” interpretation\nignores the sculptors’ imagination and creativity.

The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined\ninterpretation in this way. Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or\nanimals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice B is incorrect.

                "paragraph": "During a history lesson, students learned about the ancient city of Petra. Located in Jordan, Petra was a major trading center for over a thousand years. Its history dates back to the 6th century BC when the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, settled there. The Nabataeans used their knowledge of water management to create a sophisticated irrigation system, which allowed them to grow crops and raise animals in the desert. They also built elaborate temples and tombs, carved into the sheer rock faces of the surrounding mountains. Petra's architectural achievements are renowned for their beauty and ingenuity. In the 2nd century AD, Petra became part of the Roman Empire and continued to prosper as a trading hub. However, a series of earthquakes and the rise of sea trade led to its decline in the 6th century AD. Centuries later, Petra was rediscovered by European explorers in the 19th century and has since become a popular tourist destination.",
                "explanation": "The paragraph explains that Petra's irrigation system allowed the Nabataeans to grow crops and raise animals in the desert and contributed to Petra's architectural achievements. It also says that Petra was a major trading center for over a thousand years, but it does not mention that the irrigation system had anything to do with this. The correct answer is therefore B.",

Scientists assumed the diatoms were thriving on nutrients such as phosphate\nfrom the lava, but analysis showed these nutrients weren’t present near the surface in forms diatoms can consume.\nHowever, there was an abundance of usable nitrate, a nutrient usually found in much deeper water and almost never\nfound in lava. Microbial oceanographer Sonya Dyhrman and colleagues believe that as the lava plunged nearly 300\nmeters below the surface it dislodged pockets of this nutrient, releasing it to float upward, given that <u>______<u>",
                "explanation": "The claim is that the lava freed the deep nitrate, allowing it to float upward.
